## Friction log summary

| Category | Count | Worst example |
|----------|-------|---------------|

| (d) Genuinely unpredictable | | |

## Did structured planning outperform "just chat with Claude"?

_Be honest. For each planning artifact, would an unstructured conversation have produced the same or better result?_

- **RESEARCH.md:** [Better / Same / Worse than ad-hoc research]
- **SCOPE.md:** [Better / Same / Worse than just starting to build]
- **DATA_MODEL.md:** [Better / Same / Worse than discovering schema during build]
- **BUILD_PLAN.md:** [Better / Same / Worse than intuitive sequencing]
- **.cursorrules:** [Better / Same / Worse than inline context]

## Revenue signal

- **Did anyone try it?** [yes/no, how many]
- **Did anyone express willingness to pay?** [yes/no, context]
- **What's the next revenue test?** [action]
