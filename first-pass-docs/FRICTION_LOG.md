# Friction Log: [Project Name]

> **Capture rule:** Write it down THE MOMENT it happens. Not end of day. Not "I'll remember."
> **What counts as friction:** Any decision the spec didn't cover. Any rework caused by ambiguous scope. Any "I should have known this Monday." Any time Cursor produced wrong output because the .cursorrules was unclear.

## Patterns

_Fill this in Friday afternoon. Look across all entries._

### Most common category
_Which category (a/b/c/d) appeared most? That's what the pipeline needs to get better at._

### Worst single friction point
_Which entry cost the most time or caused the most rework?_

### Cursor-specific friction
_Times where Cursor produced wrong/bad code specifically because the planning artifacts were unclear or missing information. These are the highest-signal entries for pipeline improvement._

### Spec gaps
_Things you had to decide during the build that should have been decided Monday. List them — they become additions to next week's templates._
