    "title": "Ask HN: Am I holding it wrong?",
    "content": "I've been steadfastly trying my best to incorporate the latest-and-greatest models into my workflow. I've been primarily using Codex recently. But I'm still having difficulties.For example: no matter what I do, I can't prevent Codex from introducing linter errors.I use tabs instead of spaces for indentation. It seems like the model is massively weighted on code written using spaces (duh). Despite having a very well articulated styleguide (that Codex helped me write after examining my codebase!) that clearly specifies that tabs are used for indentation, the model will happily go off and make a bunch of changes that incorporate spaces seemingly at random. It will use tabs correctly in certain places, but then devolve back to using spaces later on in the same files.I have a linter that I've taught the model to run to catch these things, but A) that feels like such a waste of tokens and B) the model often forgets to run the linter anyway.It's like having a junior developer who has never used the tab key before. They remember to ctrl-f their spaces->tabs sometimes before opening a PR, but not all the time. So I wind up giving them the same feedback over and over.This example -- tabs instead of spaces -- is just one specific case where the model seems to invariably converge on a local maximum that is dictated by the center of the software bell curve. But in general I'm finding it to be true of just about any &quot;quirky&quot; style opinion I want to enforce:- Avoid Typescript's `any` or `unknown`: the model will still happily throw these in to make the compiler happy- Avoid complex ternaries: nope, the model loves these- Avoid inscrutable one-letter variables versus longer, self-descriptive ones: nope, `a` it isIt just seems like I'm using a tool that is really good at producing the average software output by the average software developer. It's not able to keep my aesthetic &#x2F; architectural desires at the front of its thinking as it's making my desired changes. It's as if I hired the guy from Memento as an intern.How do people get around this, other than slathering on even more admonitions to use tabs no matter what (thereby wasting valuable tokens)?Beyond syntax, I'm still able to use the models to crudely implement new features or functionality, but the way they write code feels... inelegant. There's often a single unifying insight within grasp that the model could reach for to greatly simplify the code it wrote for a given task, but it's not able to see it without me telling it that it's there.",

Most existing solutions were either bloated Electron apps or expensive cloud subscriptions.I wanted something instant, local-first, and privacy-focused. So, I spent my nights learning Rust, heavily utilizing AI coding assistants to navigate the steep learning curve and the borrow checker. This project is a testament to how domain experts can build performant native software with AI support.I built this viewer using Tauri and wgpu for rendering.Key Features:Native Performance: Opens 500MB+ MRI series instantly (No Electron, no web wrappers).GPU-Accelerated: Custom wgpu pipeline for 3D Volume Rendering and MPR.BoneFidelity: A custom algorithm I developed specifically for high-fidelity bone visualization.Privacy: Local-first, runs offline, no cloud uploads.It is currently available on the Microsoft Store as a free hobby project.Disclaimer: This is intended for academic&#x2F;research use and is NOT FDA&#x2F;CE certified for clinical diagnosis.I am evaluating open-source licensing options to make this a community tool.

We are observing a persistent high-volume layoff cycle (~25k YTD) occurring simultaneously with a projected $5.5T global economic loss attributed to unfilled technical roles (IDC).This suggests we aren't witnessing a cyclical downturn, but a structural &quot;displacement event&quot; driven by a rotation in capital and compute requirements.Three observations for discussion:1. *The Infrastructure Bottleneck:* While application-layer development is being compressed by agentic IDEs and higher-level abstractions, the demand for the &quot;underlying&quot; stack (vector orchestration, GPU cluster optimization, custom RAG pipelines) has entered a state of acute scarcity. \n2. *The Depreciation of Mid-Level Generalism:* We are seeing a &quot;Mid-Level Squeeze&quot; where companies prioritize either &quot;AI-Native&quot; entry-level talent (low cost, high adaptability) or Staff-level architects. The traditional 4-8 YOE generalist feature developer appears to be the primary demographic of the current layoff cycle.\n3. *The Revenue-to-Engineer Ratio:* For the first time, we are seeing &quot;Agentic&quot; teams of 2-3 engineers maintaining systems that previously required 15-20. This shift isn't just about efficiency; it's about the fundamental unit of labor changing from &quot;writing lines of code&quot; to &quot;orchestrating system logic.&quot;Is the $5.5T &quot;gap&quot; actually fillable by the current workforce, or are we looking at a permanent bifurcation where a large segment of the legacy SWE population becomes structurally unemployable without a complete ground-up retraining in the data&#x2F;inference pipeline?",
